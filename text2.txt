My name is Abhinav (8074831312). I was born on 14 January 2003 (14-01-2003), which makes me 21 years, 1 month, 2 days old. I don't remember the exact time I was born, else I would've put that in the text as well. I was born in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh and I lived there until I completed my 10th grade. Then my family and I shifted to Hyderabad where I completed my Intermediate and UG. Currently, I am doing my masters from Christ (Deemed to be University), Bangalore. Coming to what kind of a life I've led until now. Very non-chalant, more like your bullied-kid story from the american high school movies. You know if you know. If you're wondering about the other end of things, i.e. *in a hush low voice* psst..psst.. relationships! No. I don't have anyone, nor am I interested in anyone. I have my reasons to be so, on which I am not willing to elaborate. My academics are fine. I do pretty well for my skill level. Pass the subjects and make sure I survive. And my parents are absolutely fine with it. They don't have any issues with my attitude towards marks cause they know what I am and what my skills are. As of family, I don't have any other than my parents and my grandmother (naani) and my mum's big brother. I'm kind of an anomaly in the family. I was the last second boy in the family, this is my father's side family that we're talking about. And right after me, my cousin who happens to be the fist girl in the family in my genereation. (you know what I mean). And just like that I became the ignored offspring in my dad's family, kind of an outcast if you will. My father's brothers and sister pamper my cousin a lot, and as a kid I never was involved in any of the stuff, so it didn't matter to me that much. Even on my mother's family other than my naani and mama, no one really cared or even talked to me. So, yeah, that's why I always say that I have no family, other than the ones I mentioned. Pretty rough, right? Don't you worry, my entire life has been like this. Never had any good friends. except for that one or two. Roshni happens to be one of them. I absolutely love her, platonically. She's the only woman other than my mum who can handle my insanity. If I do ever get a chance, I would love to take her out sometime. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ 13-01-2004 and 16-05-2003 and 19-12-2001 and 6-03-2002 and 14-09-2002 and 15 March 2023. 9441019787. 9000721122. 6303649827. 090909097.
