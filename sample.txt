This is a paragraph on how i got into automobiles. I actually wanted to become an airforce pilot. I was very much into speed and going fast and al that kind of stuff. But there was one issue, finance. My parents weren't able to afford, at that time. If I wanted to do it now, they would've been able to afford. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😍😍😍😍😍👌👌🤣🙌🙌🎶🎶🎶 Okay, let's get back on track, I like the feeling of speed. Feeling that wind in your hair is a different kind of feeling. I used to ask my dad to take me on bike rides just to experience that feeling. And what was the next best thing if you couldn't become a pilot. Bikes, and Cars.
That's how I got into them. Basically, gotten addicted to them. And I'm so familiar with them that I can identify what kind of car/bike it is just by the exhaust notes. A lot of people called me a kid for that. I mean I get it, I kind of become a kid, when I'm around cars or bikes. I can talk hours and hours about them, describing all kinds of engines, engine configurations, different components, brands and their history. If you were to ask me what my dream garge would include, it would something like, a Ducati Panigale V4R, 2018 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R (the older one), a Porsche 991.2 GT3 RS Weissach and a Lamborghini Huracan Performante. That would be my perfect garage, and If i were to include a few garage queens, then a Royal Enfield Continental GT650 in Mr. Clean and a Porsche 930 Turbo from the early 90s', famously known as "The Widowmaker". Going back to the point of why I like automobiles, if I have to be brutally honest about it, I know I like the feeling of speed, and how giddy it makes me to go a 120kmph on the highway, or that feeling of "Oh my god, I was about to die!" when you save yourself  from an accident, and all. All of these are good and amazing, but I'll tell you what I think. It's just basic human instinct. That thirst of humans to tame things that we can't control. History has shown us that whenever there is something that people say can't be done, there will always be someone who says "Well, why can't you?" and then proceeds to do it, and break all the stereotypes, and the words of those people who said so. And that is where this comes from. This thirst. That idea. The idea of a machine that could go 300+ kmph on a single wheel. The idea of a machine that weighs less than a horse, but has more 200 horsepower. A machine that lifts up it's front wheel like it doesn't have one. A Mahcine that could kill you faster than you could even think about how to control it. If that machine can do all of this, it's not a machine, it's a living thing. A beast. A beast with a beating heart.
One that drinks fuel, breathes fires and roars like a beast. That is what drive me. That is what I like about them. That close-to-death feeling. That is what I want. That is what makes me feel alive.
